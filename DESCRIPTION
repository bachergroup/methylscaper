Title: Visualization of Methylation Data
Description: `methylscaper` is an R package that provides functions for processing andvisualizing data generated by methods jointly profiling methylation and chromatin accessibility (MAPit, NOMe-seq, scNMT-seq, nanoNOMe, etc.). The package offers processing forboth single-cell and single-molecule data, and a common interface for jointly visualizing both data types through the generation of ordered representational methylation-state matrices. The package provides a Shiny app to allow for interactive seriation process of refinement and re-weighting that optimally orders the single DNA molecules to discover methylation patterns and nucleosome positioning.
